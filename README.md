# Book store project
This is a project to demonstrate Nhuan Do's skills in React and web development in general, as proof of my experience (PoE) and learning in the past.

The demonstration hosted on Netlify could be accessed at the link above. Everyone can see all the books but need to be authenticated to create a new book (for sale). With authenticated users, they could also edit and delete their books. If you went to this demonstration website, you should try functions like:
  - Create a password-based account.
  - Log in to your account by password, and log out.
  - Add your own new books.
  - Search books by typing some terms at the search bar.
  - Go to the detail page by clicking on a book you want.
  - On the detail page, edit or delete that book (if it was created by you).

I consider myself as just a fresh graduate in computer science from HCMUT, and now I am also in the last one-third of my IELTS course at BKEnglish and do not have a full-time job. Therefore, if any employer or HR has related positions and is interested in my project, you can ask me anything about this project via [nhuandongoc@gmail.com](mailto:nhuandongoc@gmail.com).
